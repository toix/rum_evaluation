## How to Evaluate a Reviewer

Per Capn Jimbo's analysis, a reliable reviewer should show:

1. **Normal distribution** - Most scores around the median, fewer extremes
2. **No high-end bias** - If 66/100 rums score 9-10, that's inflation
3. **Willingness to give low scores** - Honest reviewers find bad rums too
4. **Transparency about methodology** - Clear criteria, consistent application
5. **Independence** - No financial ties to distilleries

## Red Flags in Rum Reviews

- Reviewer never mentions added sugar
- Every "premium" rum scores 90+
- No critical reviews in their archive
- Heavy emphasis on bottle design and marketing
- Reviewer receives free samples without disclosure
