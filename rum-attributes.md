# Understanding Rum: Key Attributes

A guide to the attributes that define rum quality and character.

---

## Production Attributes

### Distillation Method

The still type fundamentally shapes flavor:

| Still Type | Character | Examples |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Pot Still** | Full-bodied, rich, complex esters | Hampden, Worthy Park, Foursquare (some) |
| **Column Still** | Lighter, cleaner, more neutral | Most mass-market rums |
| **Blended** | Balance of both | Appleton, Foursquare, many premium rums |

**Pot stills** produce "heavier" distillates with more flavor compounds (congeners). Think of the difference between a single malt whisky and vodka.

**Column stills** can produce very high-proof, neutral spirit. Multi-column industrial stills create the lightest, most neutral rum.

### Source Material

| Material | Style | Character |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| **Molasses** | Traditional rum | Sweet, caramel, vanilla base. 95%+ of world rum. |
| **Fresh cane juice** | Rhum Agricole | Grassy, vegetal, fresh. French Caribbean. |
| **Cane syrup** | Regional variations | Between the two |

**Rhum Agricole** (Martinique, Guadeloupe) has AOC designation like French wine - strict production rules. Tastes completely different from molasses rum: grassy, herbal, sometimes funky.

### Age Statements (The Truth)

**What age means:**
- Rum gains color, complexity, and smoothness from barrel aging
- Tropical aging (Caribbean) is ~3x faster than temperate (Scotland)
- A 12-year Caribbean rum has similar maturity to a 30-year Scotch

**How to read age statements:**

| Label | What It Actually Means |
|-------|------------------------|
| "12 Year" | Youngest rum in blend is 12 years |
| "Solera 23" | **NOT 23 years old!** Solera blend where oldest is 23, average ~6-8 years |
| "XO" | Minimum 6 years (often marketing speak) |
| No age statement | Could be any age, often young |

**The Solera trick:** Ron Zacapa "23" and similar use Solera systems. The "23" is the maximum age, not minimum. Average age is typically much lower.

### ABV (Alcohol by Volume)

| ABV | Character | Your Preference |
|-----|-----------|-----------------|
| 40% | Standard, often diluted | Standard |
| **43-45%** | More flavor retained | **Preferred** |
| 46-50% | High proof, intense | Good |
| 50-60% | Cask strength | For experienced |
| 60%+ | Overproof | Cocktails |

**Note:** Higher ABV means more flavor compounds survive dilution. However, rounded flavor and balanced sugar (5-20 g/L) matters more than ABV alone.

**Your preference (rounded + sweet spot) options in 30-50€:**
- Santa Teresa 1796 (40%, 6-12 g/L) - **#1 Pick**
- El Dorado 12 (40%, ~15 g/L)
- Brugal XV (38%, ~7 g/L)
- Havana Club SdM (45%, 0-6 g/L) - naturally rounded

### Cask Types

~99% of rum ages in **ex-bourbon barrels** (cheap, plentiful). Premium rums often use additional cask types for finishing.

#### Primary Cask Types

| Cask Type | Size | Flavor Impact |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| **Ex-Bourbon** | 200L | Vanilla, honey, caramel, coconut. The standard. |
| **Ex-Sherry (Oloroso)** | 475-600L | Dried fruit, nuts, leather, drier finish |
| **Ex-Sherry (Pedro Ximénez/PX)** | 475-600L | Raisins, figs, dates, sweetest finish |
| **Ex-Port** | 550-650L | Red berries, strawberry, medium sweetness |
| **Ex-Cognac** | 250-300L | Vanilla, pepper, subtle spice, elegance |
| **Ex-Madeira** | Various | Nutty, caramel, oxidative notes |

#### Double Aging / Finishing

Most rum ages first in **ex-bourbon**, then **finishes** in another cask type for final months/years. This adds complexity without overwhelming the base spirit.

**Example:** Doorly's XO ages 5 years in bourbon casks, then 3 more years in oloroso sherry casks.

#### Sherry Cask Types Explained

| Sherry Type | Character | Sweetness |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Fino** | Light, dry, almond | Driest |
| **Oloroso** | Nutty, dried fruit | Medium |
| **Palo Cortado** | Between Fino & Oloroso | Medium |
| **Cream** | Blended, smooth | Sweet |
| **Pedro Ximénez (PX)** | Raisins, figs, syrup | Sweetest |

**Oloroso** is most common for rum finishing - adds richness without excessive sweetness.
**PX** adds significant sweetness - can mask or enhance depending on use.

#### Cask Size Matters

| Size | Name | Effect |
|------|------|--------|
| 200L | Bourbon barrel | Standard, good wood contact |
| 250-300L | Barrique | Common for cognac/wine |
| 475-600L | Sherry butt | Less wood contact, subtler influence |
| 550-650L | Port pipe | Less wood contact |

Smaller casks = more wood contact = faster maturation and stronger wood influence.

## Additives

### Added Sugar

**The controversial truth:** Many "premium" aged rums contain significant added sugar.

| Sugar Level | Interpretation | Examples |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| 0-5 g/L | Natural (from barrel aging) | Foursquare, Hampden, most Jamaican |
| 5-20 g/L | Some sweetening | Plantation expressions |
| 20-40 g/L | Significantly sweetened | Diplomatico, Zacapa (historic) |
| 40+ g/L | Approaching liqueur | Don Papa, A.H. Riise |
| 100 g/L | Reference: Coca-Cola | - |

**Why it matters:**
- Sugar masks flaws and lack of complexity
- Creates artificially "smooth" perception
- Not disclosed on most labels
- EU now limits "rum" label to 20 g/L maximum

**Countries with no-sugar laws:**
- **Jamaica** - Illegal to add sugar
- **Barbados** - Illegal to add sugar
- **Martinique** (AOC rums) - Illegal to add sugar

### Other Additives

| Additive | Purpose | How to Detect |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Glycerin** | Adds viscosity/"legs" | Lab testing, hydrometer |
| **Vanillin** | Artificial vanilla flavor | Lab testing |
| **Caramel (E150)** | Darkens color, suggests age | Often legal and disclosed |

**Color is not age:** Many young rums add caramel to look older. Some aged rums are filtered clear. Never judge age by color alone.

## Classification Systems

### The Gargano Classification

Developed by Luca Gargano (Velier), modeled on Scotch whisky categories:

| Category | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **Pure Single Rum** | 100% pot still, single distillery, single vintage |
| **Single Blended Rum** | Pot + column still blend, single distillery |
| **Traditional Rum** | Coffey (traditional column) still |
| **Rum** | Multi-column industrial still |

**Why it matters:** A "Pure Single Rum" from Hampden is fundamentally different from industrial column-still rum, even if both say "rum" on the label.

### Geographic Styles

| Origin | Typical Character |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Jamaica** | Funky, high-ester, tropical fruit, banana. No sugar. |
| **Barbados** | Balanced, elegant, oak-forward. No sugar. |
| **Guyana (Demerara)** | Rich, heavy, molasses-forward. Some sugar. |
| **Trinidad** | Light, aromatic, Spanish-style. |
| **Martinique** | Agricole - grassy, vegetal, fresh cane. AOC protected. |
| **Venezuela/Guatemala** | Sweet, smooth, often heavily sugared. |
| **Philippines** | Very sweet, often spirit drinks not rum. |

### Ester Levels (The "Funk")

Esters are flavor compounds created during fermentation. Measured in grams per hectoliter of pure alcohol (g/hlpa).

| Ester Level | Character |
|-------------|-----------|
| < 50 g/hlpa | Light, clean, neutral |
| 50-200 | Moderate complexity |
| 200-500 | "Funky" - tropical fruit, overripe banana |
| 500-1500 | High ester - intense, challenging, Jamaican style |
| 1500+ | Extreme - Hampden DOK, acquired taste |

**Jamaican "funk"** is polarizing. Some love the tropical fruit bomb; others find it overwhelming. Hampden Estate is the most famous high-ester producer.

## Quality Indicators

### What to Look For

**Positive signs:**
- Age statement with minimum age (not Solera maximum)
- Single distillery/estate origin
- Disclosed production method (pot still, column, blend)
- Bottled at 43%+ ABV
- No added sugar or transparent about it
- Competition medals (IWSC Gold, SFWSC Double Gold)

**Warning signs:**
- "Solera" age statements (misleading)
- Very dark color with young age (added caramel)
- Extremely smooth at low price (added sugar)
- "Premium" marketing with no production details
- Labeled "spirit drink" instead of "rum" (too much sugar for EU)

### Value Assessment

| Factor | High Value | Low Value |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Age** | Actual stated age | Solera/misleading |
| **Sugar** | 0-5 g/L | 40+ g/L |
| **Transparency** | Full production details | Marketing only |
| **Origin** | Jamaica, Barbados, Martinique | Varies |
| **Competition** | Multiple gold medals | None or pay-to-play awards |

## Reading a Rum Label

### What's Required vs. Marketing

**Usually required:**
- ABV percentage
- Volume
- Country of origin (sometimes)
- "Rum" or "Spirit Drink" designation

**Often marketing:**
- Age numbers (can be misleading)
- "Premium," "Reserve," "XO"
- Dark color
- Medal imagery (check if legitimate)
- Stories about tradition/heritage

### Example Label Analysis

**"Ron Zacapa Solera 23"**
- "Solera 23" = Blend with oldest component 23 years, average ~6-8 years
- Guatemala origin
- ~15-25 g/L added sugar (varies by market)
- Sweet, smooth, approachable - but not what label implies

**"Hampden Estate 8 Year"**
- "8 Year" = Youngest rum is 8 years old
- Jamaica origin (no added sugar by law)
- Pure pot still, single estate
- High ester, funky, complex - exactly what label says
