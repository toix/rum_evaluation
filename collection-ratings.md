## Detailed Notes

### Ron Zacapa 23 (7.5/10)
- **Origin:** Guatemala
- **Sugar:** 15-45 g/L (varies by market)
- **Age:** Solera 6-23yr (misleading - average ~6-8yr)
- **Cask:** Sherry + Bourbon
- **Notes:** Gateway rum, sherry masked by sugar. Your Zacapa is acceptable but you'd taste more sherry character in Doorly's XO.

### Botucal/Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva (7/10)
- **Origin:** Venezuela
- **Sugar:** 20-40 g/L (EU version ~20 g/L)
- **Age:** Up to 12yr blend
- **Cask:** Bourbon
- **Notes:** Crowd-pleaser, good for parties. Very smooth but artificial smoothness from sugar.

### Don Papa Masskara (5/10)
- **Origin:** Philippines
- **Sugar:** 25-29 g/L + additives
- **Additives:** Glycerin (2.4 g/L), Vanillin (359 mg/L), honey, chili
- **Notes:** Not legally "rum" in EU - labeled "spirit drink." Fun party drink but not representative of rum.

### A.H. Riise 1888 (4/10)
- **Origin:** Virgin Islands
- **Sugar:** 85-96 g/L (brand average)
- **Age:** 6yr
- **Notes:** Nearly liqueur territory. For reference, Coca-Cola is 100 g/L. Brand openly admits high sugar, labels as "spirit drink" in EU.

### Weis Conde Tovar (?/10)
- **Origin:** Venezuela (Colonia Tovar), matured in Germany
- **Sugar:** Unknown - claimed unsweetened
- **Age:** 8yr
- **Notes:** Boutique rum, no major reviews available. Potentially the most authentic in your collection.

## What's Missing

Your collection needs:
1. **Rounded flavor** - Most of yours are too sweet, masking complexity
2. **Sweet spot sugar** - 5-20 g/L instead of 20-96 g/L
3. **Balance** - Smooth without being cloying

**Fix with:** Santa Teresa 1796 (6-12 g/L, rounded), El Dorado 12 (~15 g/L), or Brugal XV (~7 g/L)
